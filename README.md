Simon game is purely made on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This game is based on your memory so when game starts a one of the four color button blink you 
just need to click that button and you go on to next level, so the trick starts from level 2 now in order to advance to level 3 you have to press the 
button which blinked on level 1 and level 2 both in correct order.  So if you are in level 7 then you have to click 7 buttons right from level 1 to level 7 
if you mess-up and do wrong then game ends.
